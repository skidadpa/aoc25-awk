AWK solutions for Advent of Code 2025
=====================================
I decided to implement the Advent of Code challenges this year in AWK. This
daily programming challenge can be found at http://www.adventofcode.com.

Here are my solutions. There is a folder for each day, each containing:

| file         | description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Makefile     | Makefile that runs a regression by default  |
| expected.txt | Expected results of regression test         |
| sample.txt   | sample input from the challenge description |
| input.txt    | test input from the challenge description   |
| one.awk      | first solution                              |
| two.awk      | second solution                             |
| *            | additional files as needed                  |
